Welcome to Enscale Docs GitHub Repo!

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to our documentation. We appreciate your help in making Enscale not only a better hosting platform but a well-documented one as well.

Letâ€™s get right to it, shall we?

A. Editing existing articles

1. Go to the article you wish to edit in https://enscale.com/docs and click "Edit this page".
2. Click the edit icon - this will fork the project and allow you to edit the article directly in GitHub
3.

B. Adding new articles

1. Go to the Enscale-docs git repository
2. Click "Add new file" - this will fork the project and allow you to edit the article directly in GitHub
3. Name the file docs.10.md and write your article (simple markdown)
4. Click "Propose new file" when done.

We will attempt to reach out personally to relay our thanks for your contribution, but should this not happen in a timely manner, please know that we appreciate your work and are grateful for your help.
